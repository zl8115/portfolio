    "content": "My first attempt at a Kaggle competition which is a simple <strong>Binary Classification problem</strong> or predicting Survival by learning from the RMS Titanic Passengers' Dataset. The steps taken in this project were mainly: <strong>Data Cleaning &amp; Validation</strong> to ensure the data was clean, complete and valid; <strong>Explatory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong> to better understand and create relevant features; and <strong>Model Selection and Parameter Tuning</strong> to select the model best suitable for this Binary Classification task.<br/><br/><em>Results:</em> <strong>Majority Voting Classifier</strong> scoring <strong>~0.779</strong>."

The aim of the project is to design an optical system that is able to maintain the focal plane by driving a tunable lens using a feedback loop of the acquired image - essentially develop a computationally cheap and small real-time auto-focus system.<br/><br/>Behind the technicalities, the methods primarily involved in this project included: <strong>Image Processing</strong>, <strong>Signal Processing</strong> methods and <strong>Optimization</strong> algorithms."

This is the code that won my team 1st place in the final race. This project involved using <strong>Python</strong> to program the autonomous racer. However for the remainder of the module, <strong>Matlab</strong> was also used to simulate pursuit tracking amongst other simulations."
